The Path UI
===========

This UI is more than just for the path.

I want it to be able to integrate into google maps,
to be able to create locations (points) on a map image,
while returning img coords and necessary info, and for
it to generate an adjacency list from drawing map paths.

There is no real good alternative that I could find online.

It does use external js such as
hammerJS, and JQuery Mousewheel.
