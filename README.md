WitsSoftDev13
=============

This is the University of the Witwatersrand's Software Development Student groups's 2013 (and perhaps going into 2014) project to build a mobile application for Wits Marketing. This app will allow the user to select on a map where they would like to go and from their current position to their destination it will calculate and display the shortest path.
