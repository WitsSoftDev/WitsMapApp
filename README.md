WitsSoftDev13 Phonegap Map App
==============================

This is the University of the Witwatersrand's Software Development Student groups's 2013 (and perhaps going into 2014) 
project to build a mobile application for Wits Marketing. 
This app will allow the user to select on a map where they would like to go and from their current position to their 
destination it will calculate and display the shortest path.

Basic Concept
=============

Wits marketing has asked us to create a mobile application which 
will allow the user to select on a map where they would 
like to go and from their current position to their destination, 
then it will calculate the shortest path and display it to the user.

Builds

The build is done by uploading a .zip of the repo

Original Source
--------------

This boilerplate of a phonegap 2.9.1 app is maintained by @TRex22 and @WitsSoftDev
It is from the cordova and phonegap example app.

There are more folder and files which can be included in the app, which will
be added at a later time.

This source is completely open source, under the MIT license. See below for more detail.

Branching
---------

The reason this source lies on its own branch is because the online builder requires access to
the source to be built.

The code is found within the folders which reside on the root of this repo.
