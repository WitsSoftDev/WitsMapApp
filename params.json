This security flaw can be overcome by checking every string and using HTML & clause to handle all input as strings. This flaw would only be system local but should still be considered.\r\n\r\nMySQL and PHP\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is SQL injection. A user instead of entering plaintext may enter SQL statements to cause damage throughout the entire system. There are a few ways to negate this security flaw. One method is to add “” to the end of every string as it goes into the database. A better way would be to scrub the String so that no infected text goes into the database at all.\r\nPhonegap Updates\r\nThere are a few ways to handle updates to a phonegap app. It has a built in technology  which can be added as an extra, but I don’t like it since it greatly decreases performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
