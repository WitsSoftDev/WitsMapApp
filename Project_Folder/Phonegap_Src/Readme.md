Phonegap App SRC
================

This is an src folder for initial creation, after milestone 1 different aspects will be merged.

In phonegap_project\assests\www lies the mobile app
This was Pravesh's tutorial from his app.

Remove the useless parts and then develop the mobile app.

There are also Java parts to Phonegap but they probably dont
need to be touched.

Testing
=======

I am able to build phonegap projects, and I am registered with the adobe service.
If anything does not work it is easy to fix.

The web content can be copied into a new phonegap project if needed.
